# Module-01-Challenge

## Description
A webpage that contains a few sections of information. Each link at the top will take you to the corrisponding section which contains more detailed information. This is the first Challenge issued by the DU bootcamp. The process started with some information and code that needed to be cleaned up to a functioning and semantic page.
